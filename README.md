# gba-as-controller
"GBA as Smash controller" forked from gba-as-controller/Game Boy Interface by extrems

This version builds on the incredible work extrems did that allows using a gameboy advance as a gamecube controller.

I've added code for a state machine that handles being able to double tap left or right on the d-pad to activate a sprint mode.
This is primarily for smash as it allows both precise and rapid movement for easier gameplay.

This fork was my first foray into GBA programming and I hashed out this prototype in a weekend - as such I am sure there are improvements that could be made to simplify/speed up the logic I used.
