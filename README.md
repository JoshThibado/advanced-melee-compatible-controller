# gba-as-controller
"GBA as Smash controller" forked from Game Boy Interface by extrems

This version build on the incredible work by extrems to be able to use a gameboy as a gamecube controller.
I've added code for a state machine that handles being able to double tap left or right on the d-pad to activate a sprint mode.
This is primarily for smash as it allows both precise and rapid movement for easier gameplay.

This fork was my first foray into GBA program and I hashed out this prototype in a weekend.

Let me know if you have any question by messaging me on github.
